<h2>
Thom Browne Unleashes a Troupe of Battle-Scarred Men for FW16
</h2>
by Alec Leach from <a href="http://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/01/25/thom-browne-fall-winter-2016/"><em>High Snobiety</em></a><br>
<p>The last show of the jam-packed Paris Fashion Week schedule was Thom Browne. Never shy of a bit of theatrics (see his beautiful geisha-tinged SS16 show), Browne’s show saw a troupe of models – faces covered by top hats – parade around a diorama of frames, with a final result looking a bit like a luxe-menswear version of Magritte’s Not to be Reproduced. <br>

In terms of clothing, Browne’s staple shrunken grey suiting, of course, took center stage, although this time it was torn, shredded and battle-scarred – as if his boys had just returned from fighting a very well-dressed war. Browne’s outerwear arsenal included pieces lined with fur, patterned with chevrons and cropped into blousons, with a scattering of patch-worked pieces looking like they were only seconds away from falling apart completely.<br>


Elsewhere, briefcases shaped like wiener dogs proved that making very expensive grey suits doesn’t mean you can’t have a sense of humor. Those cases will join turtle-shaped backpacks and whale bags in Browne’s archive of (very expensive) novelty accessories.<br>

Overall, pretty much business as usual for Thom Browne – a designer whose place as a menswear legend was cemented long ago. Browne’s stiff, buttoned-up aesthetic may have changed little, but he continues to wow the menswear industry with his commitment to theatrics, tongue-in-cheek flairs and breathtaking statement pieces. You really have to wonder how much work must go in to crafting those jaw-dropping shredded coats – they’ll probably end up in a menswear museum somewhere down the line.</p>

Thom Browne Shares the Inspiration Behind His Suits "I Never Thought I Would Reference My Father as Much as I Did"
</h3>

Thom Browne is known for producing high-quality tailored menswear pieces like his iconic cropped suit. The shrunken silhouette took cues from the working man's suit of the early '60s, with a slim body and narrow lapels. In a new video for The New York Times, Browne reveals where he got the inspiration for the look that changed menswear.<br>

"I never thought I would reference my father as much as i did.  He wore a suit everyday, because he just did," Browne says. "He never thought about clothing. That was just something that he wore. I love to keep pushing the idea of almost uniformity and the idea of not as much choice."<br>

Browne has a reputation for minimalism, making his pieces uniform-esque. With neutral color palettes, that always include the color gray, because he feels it is timeless. <br>

Unlike most designers, Brown says that from the beginning he wanted to be outside the world of fashion. A look inside his studio revealed  a sparse, but curated space where everyone dresses very similarly to Browne, all sporting perfectly tailored menswear pieces. </p>

<h4>Brooks Brothers to Discontinue Thom Browne’s Black Fleece Line</h4>

 <p> 
 After 8 years of designing the Black Fleece line for Brooks Brothers, Thom Browne’s services will no longer be needed, according to WWD. The reason this partnership will cease to exist is all speculation at the moment, but it’s rumored the decision was based on Browne’s ambitions to develop his personal line – specifically his investment in women’s wear. Black Fleece was considered a financial success for Brooks Brothers despite its niche following, accounting for annual sales of over $10 million. Following the Fall/Winter 2015 season, Black Fleece will go on hiatus until further notice.</p><br>
