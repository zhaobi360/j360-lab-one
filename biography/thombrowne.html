Biography
</h1> 
<p><strong>Thom Browne</strong>,  (born 1965, Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American fashion designer known for his reconceptualization of the classic men’s suit. He became widely recognized for his women’s wear after U.S. first lady Michelle Obama wore one of his designs to the 2013 presidential inauguration. <br>
His distinctive approach to formal menswear won him a Council of Fashion Designers of America award in 2006 and one from GQ magazine for Designer of the Year in 2008 – Thom Browne is a fashion designer from Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
After graduating from William Allen High School, he studied at University of Notre Dame and attained a business management and economics degree. There he was one of the members of the swim team. However, he was not greatly interested in the sport to continue it for life. He then steered his focus towards acting and went to Los Angeles to pursue a career in this field. Browne found some work, especially in commercials. This muse was soon over when he realized that while playing around and experimenting with vintage apparels along with Johnson Hartig, his friend, he has developed a fondness for clothes. Since then he started designing and cutting his own outfits without knowing much about the skill. Hence, Browne quit the idea of acting and sold his car to move to another city.</p><br>
